# Embedded Systems Engineer Playbook

## Overview
This repository is a structured playbook covering embedded systems concepts,
design decisions, and interview explanations based on real-world firmware
and system-level experience.

## What This Repository Covers
- Embedded C and modern C++ for constrained systems
- FreeRTOS concepts and real-time firmware design
- Embedded Linux system fundamentals
- Communication protocols used in embedded products
- Debugging techniques and failure analysis
- Real project stories from EV charger and BMS domains

## How to Use This Repository
Each section contains concise explanations, practical insights,
and interview-ready talking points.

This repository is intended to demonstrate **how I think and explain systems**,
not to expose proprietary or production code.

## Target Audience
- Embedded Firmware Engineers
- Embedded Linux Engineers
- Interviewers evaluating system-level understanding

## Interview Talking Points
- Why RTOS is required in real products
- How Embedded Linux differs from RTOS
- How communication protocols fail in the field
- How timing and memory issues are debugged
